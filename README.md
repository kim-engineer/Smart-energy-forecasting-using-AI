# Smart Energy Forecasting using AI
A real-world AI project focused on forecasting electricity consumption for smart buildings and hostels — enabling predictive automation, cost optimization, and energy efficiency.

## 🌍 Profile
**Author:** Evans Kimutai  
**Focus Area:** AI & Smart Energy Systems  
**Objective:** Building intelligent engineering solutions for real-world sustainability challenges.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Energy cost volatility is a major issue for buildings, hostels, and commercial apartments — especially in emerging markets. Most institutions react **after high bills arrive**, instead of predicting and optimizing ahead of time.

## ✅ What this project does
- Uses **AI time-series forecasting** to predict future energy usage  
- Helps building owners **plan and reduce power costs** before billing  
- Real-world use case — **Deployable for hostels, Airbnbs, schools, smart homes**

## 🧠 Tech Stack (Planned)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Time Series Forecasting (Prophet / LSTM)
- Streamlit Dashboard (optional)
- Future: IoT sensor integration for live monitoring

## 📌 Phase 1 (Week 1–4)
✔ Energy dataset research / simulation  
✔ Model basic forecasting prototype  
✔ GitHub commits start immediately

This is the beginning of a **global-grade engineering portfolio**.
More AI + automation projects will follow under the same professional theme.
